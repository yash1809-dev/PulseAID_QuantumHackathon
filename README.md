# 🚑 PulseAID — Real-Time ICU & Ambulance Tracking System

> *Connecting Lives to Care in Real-Time*

---

## What is PulseAID?

PulseAID is an AI-powered emergency healthcare coordination platform that eliminates the deadly delay between a medical emergency and the right care. In a crisis, patients and families waste precious minutes calling hospitals one by one, unsure of ICU availability, ambulance proximity, or whether their insurance is accepted. PulseAID solves this with a single, intelligent dashboard.

The platform provides real-time ICU bed availability across hospitals, live ambulance tracking from dispatch to arrival, and a smart matching engine that filters hospitals by insurance coverage, cost, distance, and doctor availability — all presented on an interactive map interface.

## The Problem

When a medical emergency strikes, patients face a fragmented, broken system:

- **No centralized ICU visibility** — families call hospital after hospital manually
- **No ambulance tracking** — no way to know which ambulance is nearest or available
- **No insurance-aware routing** — patients end up at hospitals that don't accept their scheme
- **No doctor availability data** — a specialist may be available at Hospital A but not Hospital B on a given day
- **Critical time lost** — every minute of delay directly impacts survival outcomes

---

## The Solution

PulseAID is a map-first web application that provides:

| Feature | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **Live ICU Map** | Color-coded hospital markers showing real-time bed availability |
| **Ambulance Dispatch** | Nearest ambulance auto-assigned and tracked from hospital to user |
| **Smart Matching Engine** | Filters and ranks hospitals by insurance, cost, distance, and doctor |
| **Doctor Registry** | Search doctors by name or specialty; view their hospital schedule |
| **Hospital Portal** | Hospitals update ICU counts, doctor availability, and accepted schemes |
| **Route Simulation** | Ambulance follows real road routes with live ETA countdown |

---

## Key Features

### For Patients (User Portal)
- Select insurance type, budget, and priority preference
- View ranked list of best-matched hospitals on the map
- One-tap ambulance request with live tracking
- Doctor search by name or specialty with cross-hospital schedule
- Real-time ETA updates as ambulance approaches

### For Hospitals (Admin Portal)
- Update ICU bed counts and equipment availability
- Manage doctor roster with shift scheduling
- Toggle accepted insurance schemes and government programs
- View incoming patient location and ETA to prepare

### Smart Matching Logic
The platform cross-references user profile data (insurance, budget) against hospital capabilities (schemes accepted, cost level, ICU availability, doctor schedule) to recommend the optimal hospital — not just the nearest one.

## Demo Flow

1. **Open app** → Full-screen map loads with hospital markers
2. **Select preferences** → Insurance type, budget, priority
3. **System ranks hospitals** → Best match highlighted with tag
4. **Request ambulance** → Nearest unit assigned automatically
5. **Live tracking begins** → Ambulance moves along route on map
6. **ETA updates live** → "Arriving in 4 min", "2 min", "Arrived"
7. **Hospital notified** → Admin portal shows incoming patient and prep status

## Hackathon Context

PulseAID was built for a national-level hackathon addressing the problem statement: *"Patients struggle to find available ICU beds and ambulances during emergencies."*

**Phase 1** — Core map dashboard with ICU tracking and ambulance simulation.

**Phase 2** — Full ecosystem: smart matching engine, doctor registry, dual-role portals (user + hospital), insurance-aware routing, and live ambulance dispatch simulation.

---

## Future Roadmap

- Integration with ABDM (Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission) APIs
- Real ambulance GPS via WebSockets
- ABHA (Ayushman Bharat Health Account) identity integration
- Aadhaar-linked document verification
- Mobile application (React Native)
- Government emergency services API integration (112 India)
